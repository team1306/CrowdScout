CrowdScout
==========

CrowdScout is Team 1306's initiative to make scouting a collaborative effort between all FRC teams.

FRC Team 1306 proposes a innovative new way to scout called CrowdScout, where teams work together to create the scouting database instead of all working separately. This allows for a consolidation of effort so that team members can be participating in the other functions which occur at an FRC tournament rather than having dozens of people scouting and collecting the same data. It would have led to a twentyfour-fold decrease in required scouting work for the Wisconsin Regional last year. We will do this by having only two scouters dedicated to each robot in each match instead of one scouter per team, then sharing the resulting data.
